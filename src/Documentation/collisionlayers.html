<h1>Sections of a PuzzleScript file</h1>
  <p>A puzzlescript file is divided into the following sections. </p>
  <ul class="nav nav-pills">
    <li><a href="prelude.html">Prelude</a></li>
    <li><a href="objects.html">Objects</a></li>
    <li><a href="legend.html">Legend</a></li>
    <li><a href="sounds.html">Sounds</a></li>

  </ul>

<h2>CollisionLayers</h2>
  <p>Objects can be placed on different layers:</p>

<pre><code>COLLISIONLAYERS
===============      
Background
Target
Player, Wall, Crate</code></pre>

<p>The purpose of layers is twofold. 
Firstly, it is about resolving movements: two objects on the same layer cannot coexist in a single cell. 
If an object tries to move into a cell where there is already an object in that layer, it will be blocked. </p>
<p>Secondly the order of layers determines in what order things are drawn.
  Objects are drawn from back to front, earlier objects are hidden by later ones.</p>
<p>The <b>background</b> layer is a special layer, below everything else. 
  Every game must have one.  Every tile must have a background tile. 
  However, by defining </p>
<pre><code>Background = Background1 or Background2</code></pre>

<p>In the <a href="legend.html">legend</a>, you can have several tile types on the background layer. 
Every tile must have a background tile. 
If you don't specify one explicitly for a tile, it is inferred based on what other background tiles are used in the level it's in.</p>

  <h3>Layer groups <img src="../images/pspatt.png" title="Pattern:Script" height="16"></h3>
  <p>If there are objects that can overflow from the cells that contain them, it may be necessary to control the order in which objects are rendered.
     The intent is to avoid one object (which includes the background) drawing over another object in an adjoining cell. 
     This is achieved by separating the collision layers into layer groups. 
     Note that this feature only affects rendering, not collision detection.</p>
  <p>Objects in (the visible part of) the level are rendered in the order defined by these rules:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All objects in the layers of a layer group are rendered before (and thus, under) the objects in the layers of higher groups.</li>
    <li>Inside a layer group, all the objects in a cell are rendered before the objects in the next cell. 
      Cell order can be redefined (see below) but defaults to what you might expect: left to right across the line, then top to bottom down the page.</li>
    <li>Inside a cell and layer group, the objects are rendered layer by layer, from the lowest layer of the group to the highest one.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>You can use a <code>--</code> line to separate layer groups. 
    So if for instance you want to make a pseudo-3D effect with background tiles filling their cells, characters and walls that overflow their cells upward, 
    and shadows under the characters and walls that overflow upward and leftward, you could have a collision layer definition like this.</p>
  
  <pre><code>Background
  Shadows
  --
  Character, Wall</code></pre>

  <p>This way you make sure that a shadow will not overdraw a character or wall in the cell above or left of the one that casts the shadow.</p>
  <p>Layer groups are not mandatory. 
    If you don't use them, all the layers are considered to be in the same group. 
    If you use them, you must use them consistently, i.e. you must use the same number of separators in all levels.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> any time you use oversized sprites, tweening or animation, where a sprite may be drawn outside the boundaries of its cell, you are 
      probably going to have to use Layer Groups to avoid rendering artefacts.</p>
  
  <h3>Rendering directions <img src="../images/pspatt.png" title="Pattern:Script" height="16"></h3>
  <p>The default cell ordering is not always what you want, so you can redefine it for each layer group. 
    To do this, add two characters after the separation line. 
    These characters can be <code>^</code> (upward), <code>v</code> (downward), <code>></code> (rightward), or <code><</code> (leftward). 
    The direction defined by the first character is used first, and when a (horizontal or vertical) line along that direction is filled, 
    the direction defined by the second character is used for a new line, parallel to the former. 
    Hence, the default group separator <code>--</code> is actually equivalent to <code>-->v</code>.</p>
  <p>Tip: if you want to make a group separator look nicer, you can add <code>--</code> at the end, like that for instance: <code>--^>--</code>.</p>
  <p>The characters <code>|</code> (default vertical direction) and <code>-</code> (default horizontal direction) can also be used. 
    They are equivalent to <code>v</code> and <code>></code> respectively. 
    A typical use of these characters is to switch for a vertical-first rendering with a group separator like <code>--|-</code>.
  
  <h3>Tags and Collision Layers <img src="../images/pspatt.png" title="Pattern:Script" height="16"></h3>
    If you use something like Player:Charge (where Charge is defined as a tag) in a collision layer, it works as if Player:Charge was defined as the following property:
    <pre><code>Player:Charge = Player:Positive or Player:Negative or Player:Neutral.</code></pre>
    
    <p>And it will thus put all three types of players in the same collision layer. 
      But sometimes you want things to go in different layers, and you can use another kind of parameter expansion for that. 
      If you write:</p>
    
    <pre><code>Charge -> Player:Charge Crate:Charge</code></pre>
    
    <p>This will generate three collisions layers (one for each value of Charge), so that it's equivalent to:</p>
    <pre><code>Player:Positive Crate:Positive
Player:Negative Crate:Negative
Player:Neutral  Crate:Neutral</code></pre>
